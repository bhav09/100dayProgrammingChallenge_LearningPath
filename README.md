# 100daysProgrammingChallenge_LearningPath



A learning path dedicated for the ones who want to start their journey of 100 day programming challenge.One needs to dedicate not more than 2 hours of the day on this. 
One hour on learning and one hour on implementing what is learned. 

The path is to take you from a Toddler in Python to a Swordsman in Machine Learning ;)

Points to ponder
* Follow these things even if you know them do not skip any. By following and practicing the ones you already know will help you in making a momentum for the challenge.

* Resources are provided in the respective folders.
